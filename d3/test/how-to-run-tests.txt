Open a shell prompt, and change into the dXX/test directory.
Then ./run-unit-tests.sh

If you need to start up tests, do this:

karma init

Answer some questions, and then you'll be good to go.

D2 , some notes

Don't forget to include angular-mocks in your config file.  This lets karma call the modules.

The order of loading is important too.  Here's what it should be:

Jasmine
jQuery (as needed)
AngularJS
Angular test files (angular-mocks.js or angular-scenario.js, but not both as they conflict)
the app under test
All other files.
